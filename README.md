# LineUp
The Line Learning App that just _works_

## What would you use LineUp for?
Learning screenplays, monologues, short sections of scripts you just can't nail down and many more

## How easy is it to use?
It's super simple! Just copy and paste your script into our webapp and hit `Start Learning`.

## Can I mod it?
Absolutely, we'd love you to fork LineUp and add it to our Community gallery of skins, features (and if it's good enough, we might put it on the OG product)

## Who made it?
LineUp is maintained and developed by @leowilkin. You can find him at wilkin.xyz - come and say hi :)
